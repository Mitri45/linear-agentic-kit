# Contributing

## Preferred model

Fork this repository and tailor it to your team/repo needs.
This project is intended as a strong baseline, not a universal standard.

Use upstream contributions only for changes that are broadly reusable across many teams.

## Scope

This repository is a markdown-first kit for agent operating standards and reusable templates.

## Change rules

- Keep templates generic and reusable.
- Keep repo-specific assumptions out of base templates.
- Prefer adding guidance in markdown over introducing tooling.
- Preserve compatibility for existing template consumers where possible.
- If a change is specific to your org/process, keep it in your fork.

## Validation before merge

1. Check all links and referenced paths exist.
2. Ensure templates contain no stale project-specific values.
3. Ensure `agent-kit-repo-adjuster` still covers post-install adaptation.
