# Execution Plans

Use this folder only for exceptional work where Linear tickets are not sufficient by themselves (for example high-risk migrations, audits, or incident timelines).

## Lifecycle

1. Draft active plan in `docs/agent/exec-plans/active/`.
2. Execute with file ownership boundaries.
3. Capture verification evidence.
4. Move finalized plan to `docs/agent/exec-plans/completed/`.

## Suggested filename

`YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md`
