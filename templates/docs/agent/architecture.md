# Architecture Map

## Runtime surfaces

- Web/client surface: `{{CLIENT_PATH}}`
- API/backend surface: `{{SERVER_PATH}}`
- Shared contracts/types: `{{SHARED_PATH}}`

## Notes

- Replace this file with repo-specific architecture references after install.
- The `agent-kit-repo-adjuster` skill is designed to do that update.
