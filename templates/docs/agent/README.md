# Agent Operating Docs

Linear issue tracker is the primary source of truth for planning/execution.
This folder defines guardrails, architecture context, and optional fallback artifacts.

## Core docs

- `core-beliefs.md`
- `architecture.md`
- `security.md`
- `quality.md`
- `ai-native-team.md`
- `mcp-setup.md`
- `workflows.md`
- `skills.md`
- `exec-plans/README.md` (optional, exceptional cases only)

## Update policy

- Keep these docs current with architecture and process.
- If these docs conflict with the nearest `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md`.
